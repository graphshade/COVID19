# Estimating Ghana's COVID19 Effective Reproduction Rate - Baysian Approach

![](https://i.imgur.com/bgBAL0x.png)
<h2>Description</h2>
The rate at which a virus is transmitted — known as the R-naught (R0), or basic reproductive number — refers to the average number of people to whom an infected person passes on the virus in a population with no pre-existing immunity. The “effective” version of that number, the Rt — or the reproductive number at time “t” — is the virus’s actual transmission rate at a given moment” - Dr. Gabriel Leung
<br></br>
The goal of this project is to estimate the most-likely value of Rt precisely enough to inform policy decision.
